# Problem #1 

## Setup
In the first problem, we are given a 2D Cartesian coordinate system to represent a section of a river. 
We are also given the speed of the water based on the x-coordinate of the location in the river.
Finally, we are told that a ferryboat is attempting to cross from point (a,0) to (0,0) where a = 7777. 
Given three different initial speeds of the boat, 7, 14, and 21, we are told to graph the trajectory the boat would make on its path from east to west.
